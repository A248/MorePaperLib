 * When a task is submitted, if the underlying entity has already been removed, the method yields
 * {@code null} or {@code false} (depending on whether the Runnable or Consumer parameter is
 * selected). Otherwise, the task is scheduled. If the entity still exists when it comes time to
 * run the task, the task is run; if the entity has ceased to exist within this time, the alternate
 * callback is run. <br>
 * <br>
 * If the implementation never becomes detached, this might be because it is either the BukkitScheduler
 * or a wrapped {@link RegionalScheduler#asAttachedScheduler()} in disguise.
